This task focuses on the **basic understanding of User Experience and User Flow**.

**UrbanVenturesüèôÔ∏è** is your ultimate gateway to discovering the hidden corners of your city or new destinations. Designed for urban explorers, solo travelers, and adventure enthusiasts, the app empowers you to uncover secret spots, share your experiences üì∏, and explore new places. Whether you're seeking the best local cafes, vibrant street art üé®, or live events, UrbanVentures transforms every moment into an unforgettable adventure.

The app offers a variety of features like discovering unique locations, connecting with fellow explorers, and sharing experiences. You can track your journey and interact with the community by rating locations, tagging hidden spots, and commenting on others' experiences. Additionally, the app features event highlights, where users can find local events and workshops, and interactive challenges like scavenger hunts that reward participation. Users can also create personalized timelines of their adventures and collaborate with local businesses for exclusive experiences or tours. UrbanVentures is more than just an exploration tool; it‚Äôs a community-driven platform where every journey leads to new discoveries.

üí° The task needs to be done in **FigJam**. No need to download FigJam because it is free to use and very simple to learn. If you‚Äôre new to FigJam, check out this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVNuArHH5WM

### **Procedure**

Imagine a new user who has just installed UrbanVentures. Your task is to design an intuitive and engaging journey for them as they explore the app for the first time.

Start by deciding:

- How the user will onboard themselves‚Äîsigning up, choosing preferences, or skipping setup entirely.
- The steps they‚Äôll take to explore the app‚Äôs key features like discovering hidden spots, connecting with other explorers, and participating in local events.
- How the user will interact with the app, rate locations, share their experiences, and track their discoveries.

Think about the order of these actions and ensure the flow feels logical, smooth, and user-friendly.

Feel free to add more features, experiment, and treat this as your playground! 

Once you‚Äôve mapped out the user flow, create a diagram in **FigJam**. When finished, save the link to your FigJam file in a **.txt file** and submit it in the **Urbanventures UX Journey** folder.
